## Contributing to Source Code

Thanks for wanting to contribute source code to Gallery+. That's great!

Before we are able to merge your code into the Gallery+ app, you need to agree to release your code under the AGPL license or to have signed the ownCloud [contributor agreement](https://owncloud.org/about/contributor-agreement/)

Please familiarise yourself with the [App development process](https://owncloud.org/dev) in order to understand how the AppFramework works and don't hesitate to contact a maintainer in order to obtain more information or tips.
It's recommended to add tests to your pull requests in order to make sure your patches work as intended. In the future, it will be impossible to merge any changes which don't include tests, so it is best to learn how they work as early as possible.
