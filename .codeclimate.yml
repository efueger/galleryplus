# This is a sample .codeclimate.yml configured for Engine analysis on Code
# Climate Platform. For an overview of the Code Climate Platform, see here:
# http://docs.codeclimate.com/article/300-the-codeclimate-platform

# Under the engines key, you can configure which engines will analyze your repo.
# Each key is an engine name. For each value, you need to specify enabled: true
# to enable the engine as well as any other engines-specific configuration.

# For more details, see here:
# http://docs.codeclimate.com/article/289-configuring-your-repository-via-codeclimate-yml#platform

# For a list of all available engines, see here:

engines:
# to turn on an engine, add it here and set enabled to `true`
# to turn off an engine, set enabled to `false` or remove it
